# Active Storage Removal - System Changes

## ‚úÖ Successfully Removed Active Storage

Active Storage has been completely removed from the PDF processing system. Here's what changed:

### üóëÔ∏è Removed Components

1. **Database Tables:**
   - `active_storage_blobs` ‚ùå
   - `active_storage_attachments` ‚ùå 
   - `active_storage_variant_records` ‚ùå

2. **Code Removed:**
   - `has_one_attached :file` from PdfDocument model
   - File upload validation
   - File attachment in PdfFolderProcessorService
   - ExtractPdfTextJob (no longer needed)
   - Web upload routes and controllers
   - PDF download functionality

3. **Views Updated:**
   - Removed upload button from index page
   - Removed new.html.erb (upload form)
   - Updated show.html.erb (removed file download)
   - Updated data_view.html.erb (removed file references)

### üîÑ Current System Functionality

#### ‚úÖ What Still Works:
- **Batch PDF Processing**: Process PDFs from folders
- **Data Extraction**: Extract licensor, licensee, addresses, dates
- **Start/End Date Extraction**: From period text
- **Property Description Corporation**: Address extraction
- **Export Functionality**: CSV and Excel exports
- **Data Viewing**: View extracted data
- **Data Reprocessing**: Reprocess existing content

#### ‚ùå What No Longer Works:
- **Web File Upload**: Disabled completely
- **File Download**: No file storage
- **File Attachment**: Files not stored in database

### üìÅ How to Add PDF Documents Now

Use **batch processing only**:

```bash
# Process all PDFs in a folder
./process_pdfs.sh process /path/to/pdf/folder

# Or using Ruby script
ruby pdf_folder_processor.rb /path/to/pdf/folder

# Or using Rails rake task
rails pdf:process_folder["/path/to/pdf/folder"]
```

### üìä Database Schema Changes

The `pdf_documents` table now contains:
- `id`, `title`, `content`, `page_count` 
- `uploaded_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- `licensor`, `licensee`, `address`
- `agreement_date`, `agreement_period`
- **NEW:** `start_date`, `end_date` (extracted from period text)
- `filename` (original PDF filename)
- `filtered_data` (structured extracted data)

### üöÄ New Features Added

1. **Start/End Date Extraction:**
   - Extracts dates from text like "commencing from 01/01/2024 and ending on 30/11/2024"
   - Stores in separate `start_date` and `end_date` fields

2. **Property Description Corporation:**
   - Better address extraction from "Property Description Corporation:" sections
   - Formats as "Corporation: Location, Other details: ..."

3. **Enhanced Export:**
   - Includes new start_date and end_date fields
   - Available in CSV and Excel formats

### üìã Migration Summary

```sql
-- Removed tables:
DROP TABLE active_storage_variant_records;
DROP TABLE active_storage_attachments; 
DROP TABLE active_storage_blobs;

-- Added columns:
ALTER TABLE pdf_documents ADD COLUMN start_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE pdf_documents ADD COLUMN end_date DATE;
```

### üîß Development Impact

- **Smaller Database**: No binary file storage
- **Faster Exports**: No large blob data
- **Simpler Architecture**: No file management complexity
- **Batch Processing Focus**: Optimized for bulk operations

### üìö Documentation References

- `BATCH_PROCESSING_README.md` - How to process PDF folders
- `EXPORT_DOCUMENTATION.md` - How to export data
- `EXPORT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick export commands

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **No File Recovery**: Original PDF files are not stored in the database
2. **Batch Processing Only**: Web upload is permanently disabled
3. **Content Preserved**: All extracted text and data remain intact
4. **Export Enhanced**: New date fields included in all exports

The system is now optimized for **batch processing** and **data analysis** rather than individual file management.
